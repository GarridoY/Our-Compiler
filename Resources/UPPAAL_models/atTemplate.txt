Invariant calculating:
Invariant needed at times to make sure at's are followed through
At operator : Invariant
== x : <= x  / Need to do it when ready else might never do it
< x  : < x-1 / Has to atleast be done by the last moment
> x  : <=    / No invariant needed, guard does all
>= x : <=    / No invariant needed, guard does all
<= x : < x   / Has to atleast be done by the last moment
